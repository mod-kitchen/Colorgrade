### Colorgrade

<hr>

### What does it do?
A shader mod for color gradations in Stardew Valley. In simple terms, it takes control of the underlying color palette used to draw the entire world, to create some neat (pretty?) visual color effects for various lighting and weather conditions in the game.  You might think of it as an upgrade to the game's ambient lighting, though that's not quite technically accurate.

### How does it work?
It accomplishes this by using color lookup tables ("LUTs"). It ships with a number of LUTs for various conditions and locations preconfigured, and allows other mod authors to create content packs to add new gradations which this mod will employ.  Some of these gradations may change over time, and this mod manages the transition from one to the next, creating complex color gradation effects while being relatively simple to create and not terribly taxing on performance.

### Does this work in multiplayer?
Yes. (Other players are entirely irrelevant to this mod.)
